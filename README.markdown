These is my development repository for my local MacPorts. Feel free to use my local ports, but remember that these are unofficial.


## Documentation

See the official [MacPorts Guide](http://guide.macports.org/) for general instruction about how to setup MacPorts, especially the section about [Local Portfile Repositories](http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories).
